## Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

Predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a common task in financial analysis. This project demonstrates how to build an LSTM model to predict the stock price of any company you choose using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

### Overview

In this project, we use historical stock price data and LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to create a predictive model. LSTM is well-suited for sequential data like time series, making it a powerful tool for stock price prediction.

### Libraries Used

We have utilized the following Python libraries in this project:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization.
- `scikit-learn`: For preprocessing and model evaluation.
- `tensorflow` or `keras`: For implementing the LSTM model.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:https://github.com/kruthikgoud/Bharathintern
2. Navigate to the project folder:
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

 Follow the step-by-step instructions in the Jupyter Notebook to load the data, preprocess it, train the LSTM model, and make predictions.

### Dataset

You can use any financial dataset that includes historical stock price data for the company you are interested in. Ensure that the dataset is in a CSV format and contains columns like 'Date' and 'Close' prices.

### Contribution Guidelines

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you'd like to improve the code, add features, or fix issues, please follow these guidelines:

- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
- Make your changes and commit them with clear and concise commit messages.
